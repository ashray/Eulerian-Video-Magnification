<p>I am a fourth year dual degree student pursuing B.Tech. + M.Tech. in Electrical Engineering(specialisation in Signal Processing) at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. My semester will complete in late April leaving me enough time to get ready for my GSoC project. If I am selected, I shall be able to work around 40 hrs a week on the project, though am open to putting in more effort if the work requires.</p>

<a id="why-this-project" class="anchor" href="#why-this-project" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why this project?</h3>

<p>This technique of motion magnification unlocks completely new avenues like detection of blood vessels,magnify motions of small babies etc. I look at this technology from the perspective of enabling a whole new dimension of use cases. So our aim should be to provide it to users/developers in as flexible form as possible so that people can build upon it for their personal use cases that they can think of. Obviously one of the use cases</p>

<p>Another advantage of this technique is that it can work in near real time. Hence it unlocks completely new avenues for technology.</p>

<p>Am currently working on many interesting projects, including Iris detection, finding out innovative techniques for improving temporal resolution of a signal(research project with <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=84VkdegAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">Prof Subhasis Chaudhuri</a>) etc. Am also currently working on implementing the video magnification algorithm. Read ahead in the personal motivation section for the reasons why I have already been working on implementing this technique.</p>

<p>I interned with Goldman Sachs technologies in my third year. My work involved extensive use of Java. Goldman involved working with teams across the globe. So I am comfortable working with people across multiple time zones and this shall not be a problem in the development process. I have worked with C++ in my advanced computing course. Based on my skills, I was selected to be a Teaching Assistant for <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-programming-part-1-iitbombayx-cs101-1x">IIT Bombay's first online course</a>, in which programming was taught in C++.</p>

<p>Programming languages I have previously worked with include C++, Java, Cilk, Python, Matlab, openGL, CUDA, Assembly Language Programming, etc.</p>

<a id="project" class="anchor" href="#project" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project</h2>

<h3>
<a id="project-abstract" class="anchor" href="#project-abstract" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Abstract</h3>

<p>This project aims to develop algorithms to extract out subtle changes in a time-dependent data set and amplify them. To begin with, the data set can be considered as videos(2D data at each temporal resolution) but scope of the project can be modified to deal with different dimensional datasets at each time instant.</p>

<h2>
<a id="technical-details" class="anchor" href="#technical-details" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Technical Details</h2>

<p>Below we have explained the significant steps of the algorithm.</p>

<ul>
<li>We first consider each of the frame of the video independently</li>
<li>We choose a suitable colour space in which we want to work, This could depend on the specific application that we are dealing with, though in the paper, authors have used NTSC colour space for further operations.</li>
<li>For each of the color(or spectrum level for hyper spectral images), we build a Laplacian pyramid. Note the Laplacian Pyramid is build of the NTSC domain image, not the RGB image.</li>
<li>We define the lowpass filter to have the Laplacian Pyramid values. Note that the Laplacian Pyramids are used to smooth in the spatial domain.</li>
<li>We consider the next frame, and perform the similar laplacian pyramid calculation on it.</li>
<li>The value of laplacian pyramids of subsequent frames is used to perform the temporal filtering of the signal. The exact method of temporal filtering could vary with application, for ex. we could use a butterworth filter, an IIR filter etc.</li>
<li>The above method will give us the lower and upper frequency bounds. We calculate the difference of them to get the frequencies that we want to filter(magnify or suppress).</li>
<li>Given the selected frequencies, we selectively magnify them based on user preference. The paper has used a linear magnification till a certain frequency and constant magnification after a certain threshold frequency as the choice, though this can be left as a user defined parameter.</li>
</ul>

<a id="personal-inspiration-for-the-project" class="anchor" href="#personal-inspiration-for-the-project" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Personal Inspiration for the Project</h3>

<p>I am really excited to work on the idea o video magnification. I have been following that topic since really long, first came to know about it from their <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/michael_rubinstein_see_invisible_motion_hear_silent_sounds_cool_creepy_we_can_t_decide?language=en">TED talk</a>, which inspired me to read their <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/vidmag/#publications">research paper</a>. I was also working in the week long <a href="https://mitredxcampjan2015.wordpress.com">ReDX camp</a> conducted by MIT Media lab(conducted by Prof Ramesh Raskar). One of the projects in that lab was to find out the human arteries. I was shocked to find out that doctors still need to stop the blood flow and then find the arteries. According to some data that was collected during the workshop, it could take upto 7 minutes to find an infants(or older people’s) correct blood vessels; in a crucial operation, this could be lethal. The team in that week had come up with an IR device which would assist the RGB camera of the cellphone and using Augmented Reality would superimpose the blood vessels(visible in IR) on to the RGB smartphone camera.</p>

<p>But I still had a problem with this solution, that we would still need a separate hardware, it could not be user friendly etc. So I wanted to apply the concept of Video Magnification to be able to magnify the blood vessel movement. This way, the injections could be correct in the first attempt and in no time.</p>

<p>So all of this was on back of my mind, churning, but my final push came from my personal experience. My grandfather had died a year ago, and when he had been taken to the hospital, the needles and stuff would pain him so much that he died in a lot of pain. From the horrible experience we had with him, my grandmother, who expired just a few months ago, was not even taken to the hospital and she died very calmly in the house. To me, this was a shock, because even in this era if people believe that hospitals actually make people’s life worse, then whats the entire point of health technology.</p>

<p>We all know that video magnification can solve this simple problem, the only issue is that it seems no one has actually put in effort to get it to the people. When I came back from my home town after this incident, I decided to take this challenge on myself. I decided to implement this technology myself, out of interest and as a course project in my Medical Image Processing course. By April end(this year), I would have myself implemented this technique(which would mean I would completely know how this works, not just have a theoretical understanding). I will be free in summers and even in the final year(5th year), we just have a research project and a course or two. It is my aim to be able to get this technology in the hands of as many people as I possibly can. I already had plans to work on an implementation of this technology in these summer vacations. I would be glad if I could do this as a part of GSOC along with Kitware.</p>

<p>I have a huge personal inspiration to get this technology out to the world, and you can be assured of my motivation to complete this project.</p>
